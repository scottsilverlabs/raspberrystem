CREATING A NEW RASPBERRYSTEM RELEASE:
    - Update Release version in ./pkg/setup.py
    - Setup up "raspberrypi" in /etc/hosts to point to the ip address of your raspberry pi
    - Clean up the raspberry pi:
        make purge-pi
        make uninstall
    - Install require install dependences on the RaspberryPi you will be building from (if you haven't already)
        - On the RaspberryPi, run the following:
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip python-pip python-epydoc zip
            (if we want to make a deb file):
                sudo pip3 install stdeb
    - Create a new branch with the name rel/<version> where <version> is the version number as defined in /pkg/setup.py
    - Checkout that branch
    - Triple check this all code is correct and you are ready to upload!
    - Register your Raspberry Pi to PyPi (only needs to be done once):
        make register  ( if on the pi run: make pi-register)
        - Create a new account, then let someone like Me add you as a maintainer to the rasperrystem package on PyPi
            - (or login to an existing one)
        - Select "yes" to save your username and password.
    - Generate new documentation:
        - generate documentation on remote raspberrypi by calling this on your computer:
            make doc
        - pull the doc file back to your computer:
            make pull-doc
        - Upload the doc.zip file onto PyPi using web interface. (there is no easy terminal command for this)

    - Upload the source code to PyPi:
        # make release  # TODO?
        make upload-cheeseshop  (if run directly on the pi run: make pi-upload-cheeseshop)

    (optional and NOT fully tested!)
    - Create a Deb package:
        make deb (on the pi run: make pi-deb)
    - Upload ppa:
        make upload-ppa (on the pi run: make pi-upload-ppa) # TODO: broken, don't do this yet!

USER INSTALLATION:
    The following instructions are for a user installing the RaspberrySTEM environment.
    NEED: RaspberryPi, SD card, Wifi USB Adapter/Ethernet, Linux/Mac/Windows

    - Install Raspbian onto the SD card by either writing the image to the SD card or using NOOBS (easier):
        http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
        NOOBS install: http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/
    - Start up your RaspberryPi and follow the setup procedures on screen.
        Options to set:
            - (optional) Change to boot directly into desktop
            - Change the timezone
            - Change keyboard to USA:
                Internationalisation Options -> Change Keyboard Layout -> Generic 101-Key PC -> Other -> English (US) -> <OK>
            - Enable the camera
    - Set up the internet using either Ethernet (not available on model A) or Wifi.
        - To set up Wifi:
            https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/setting-up-wifi-with-raspbian
    - Using the terminal, we will now install some required programs and then rstem python package.
        - run the following commands on your raspberry pi:
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install python-pip python-numpy python-pygame libi2c-dev espeak
            - pip version:
                sudo pip install raspberrystem
            - easy_install version: (Note: easy_install does not run the post install script!)
                sudo easy_install raspberrystem
            // TODO: insert user install instructions for raspberrystem-ide
            // sudo apt-get install raspberrystemide
