Snake Medium

Description
    - In this project we will continue to create a snake game that we have started to create from <Link>Snake Easy</Link>.
    - We will take the code made by that project and expand on it by providing a randomly generated apple to make the snake
        grow when the snake gets the apple.
    - Note: It is not necessary to walk through the steps of <Link>Snake Easy</Link> if you understand the starting code
        that is given to you. This code moves the snake in the direction pressed by the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT buttons.

What you will need
    - GAMER lid
    OR
    - 1 or more LED matrices
    - 4 buttons

Step 0. - Hardware
    - GAMER lid
        - Plug the GAMER lid onto the base.
    - CREATOR lid
        - [insert hardware instructions]
        // TODO: teach how to setup LED matrices and connect 4 buttons for standard UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
    - [insert review of starting code]

Step 1. - Drawing the First Apple
    - To draw our first apple, we need to first figure out where to place it.
        - Just like the snake, we are going to create a variable to remember the position of the apple.
            We will call this variable "apple_position"
            - However, now that we have a variable called "apple_position", it may seem confusing to an outside person
                reading your code to know what the "position" variable is. Therefore, lets rename it to "snake_position".
        - To make this game more fun, it would be better to place the apple at a random location each time you play the game.
            - Therefore, we are going to take advantage of the function <link>randint()</link> from the <link>random</link> module.
                - To get this function, we need to import this function similar to how to imported the cells:
                    from random import randint()
            - Next we will use the randint() function to give us a random number between the smallest and largest x and y values
                we could have.
    - Finally, we then draw the snake on the LED matrix by calling led_matrix.point() just like the snake.
