<!-- IDEAS:
    - Link to an already existing setup instructions for the LED Matrix?
    - Change terms like "while", "for", "if" into links that the user can click to get information about them?
        - Also link to led_matrix api functions which a simple explaination of how it works?

        <h1>Walking Sprite - Easy</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be demonstrating a simple animation of a guy walking. This
            will be acheived by quickly showing different sprites in succession
            to simulate the appearance of the sprite walking. Kind of like a flipbook.</p>

            <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                <!-- TODO: better explain this... -->
                <p>We first develop the sprites we want to use by calling <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> on 
                the already created <code>.spr</code> files in the same folder. These varibles will be used to
                draw on the LED matrices.
                
                <p>To animate a sprites, we need to quickly flash different sprites together in succession, 
                just like pages in a flipbook. To do this, we will use the a technique where we clear the
                display, draw and show one sprite for a couple of seconds, and then repeat for the other sprites.
                Once we have gone through all the sprites, we will then repeat the process again, starting with the
                first sprite again.
                
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the delay time of <code>.25</code> seconds on the line <code>time.sleep(.25)</code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How does this change the animation?
                            <li>What happens when you make the number bigger?
                            <li>What happens when you make the number smaller?
                        </ol>
                </ul>
