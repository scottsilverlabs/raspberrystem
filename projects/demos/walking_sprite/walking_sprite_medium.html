<!-- IDEAS:
    - Link to an already existing setup instructions for the LED Matrix?
    - Change terms like "while", "for", "if" into links that the user can click to get information about them?
        - Also link to led_matrix api functions which a simple explaination of how it works?

        <h1>Walking Sprite - Medium <br> Jumping Man</h1>
            <p>In this project we are demonstrating a simple animation of a guy walking like in 
            <a href="walking_sprite_easy.html">easy</a>
            but added the ability to press the A button to make the guy jump.</p>
            
            <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                <p>We first develop the sprites we want to use by calling <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> on 
                the already created <code>.spr</code> files in the same folder. (This is similar to how we did
                it in <a href="walking_sprite_easy.html">easy</a>, but more efficent by using a <code>for</code> 
                loop.)
                
                <p>To animate the sprites, we quickly flash through different sprites together in succession just like
                in <a href="walking_sprite_easy.html">easy</a>. However, before we draw the sprite, we first need to 
                decide if the A button has been pressed by checking <code>my_button.is_pressed()</code> 
                with an <code>if</code> statement, and then draw the sprite 2 pixels 
                higher (to simulate a jump) if the button is pressed.
                
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the delay time of <code>.25</code> seconds on the line <code>time.sleep(.25)</code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How does this change the animation?
                            <li>What happens when you make the number bigger?
                            <li>What happens when you make the number smaller?
                        </ol>
                    <li>Try changing the coordinates of the sprite when the button is pressed.
                        <ol>
                            <li>What happens to the animated guy when you press the button?
