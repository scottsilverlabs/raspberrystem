        <h1>Talking Head - Hard <br> Soundboard</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be creating a soundboard for the talking head made in
            <a href="talking_head_medium.html">medium</a>. This soundboard will allow us
            to press the buttons on the gamer lid to make the talking head say different things.
            
            <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                <p>In order to make a soundboard we need to make a dictionary that will match specific
                buttons to the sound that we want to play.
                
                <p>Then before we start playing a sound we need to keep looping through all of the buttons
                until one of the buttons has been pressed. Then, the program looks at the soundboard
                for that particular sound that matched to that button and sets that sound to be
                the <code>my_speech</code> that will be played.
        
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make your own custom soundboard by changing the text in the <code>soundboard</code> variable.
                    <li>Change the delay times in the lines <code>time.sleep(.1)</code>.
                        <ol>
                            <li>How does the face animation change?
                            <li>Does the animation still end relatively when the speech is done? Why or why not?
                            <li>What happens when the delay times aren't the same?
                        </ol>
                </ul>
