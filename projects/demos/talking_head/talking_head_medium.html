        <h1>Talking Head - Medium <br> Talking face saying "Hello World"</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be making an animated face that will move its mouth while
            the Raspberry Pi is speaking text. This will make it look like the face is actually speaking the words.
            
            <!-- TODO: Too much detail? -->
            <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                <p>We first create sprite variable for both when the face's mouth is open and when its
                closed by using <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> followed by the location of the .spr files 
                have been made.
                
                <p>Then just has before in <a href="talking_head_easy.html">easy</a> we use <code>speaker.say()</code> to 
                start speaking, however this time we wait <code>wait=False</code> because we want the program 
                to continue executing the next lines of code while the speaker is playing the speech.
                
                <p>Finally, we create a <code>while</code> loop that will continuously loop until the speech that we just started
                playing has finished playing. This loop will continuously open and close the mouth while the speech is playing
                by displaying the open and closed mouth sprites one after the other. <i>(Similar to
                <a href="../scrolling_text/scrolling_text_medium.html">scrolling text medium</a>)</i>
                
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the text "Hello World" to something else.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Does the face talking stops talking after the speech is done?
                                <p>Try using longer and shorter text.
                        </ol>
                    <li>Change the delay times in the lines <code>time.sleep(.1)</code>.
                        <ol>
                            <li>How does the face animation change?
                            <li>Does the animation still end relatively when the speech is done? Why or why not?
                            <li>What happens when the delay times aren't the same?
                        </ol>
                </ul>
