        <h1>Talking Head - Easy <br> Saying "Hello World"</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be showing how to get the Raspberry Pi to convert
            given text such as "Hello World" into speach and then play it.
            
            <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                <p>When we call the line <code>speaker.say("Hello World")</code>, this tells the Raspberry Pi
                to use its magical computing powers to play the given text in a robotic voice.
                
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the text "Hello World" to something else.
                        <ol>
                            <li>How did it sound?
                        </ol>
                    <!-- TODO: better word this -->
                    <li>Try adding more lines similar to the one above but with different text.
                        <ol>
                            <li>What does it do?
                            <li>What happens if you change <code>wait=True</code> to <code>wait=False</code>?
                </ul>
