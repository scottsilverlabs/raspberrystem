                   <h3>Need:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 LED matrix cell
                        <li>6 male to female jumper wires
                        <li>1 male to male jumper wire
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Steps:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Place the LED matrix cells on the breadboard, using the 4 pins of each matrix as support. 
                                <!-- TODO: we have the 4 pins? -->
                            <li>Using the 6 male to female jumper wires, connect the 6 pins of the first matrix (the matrix with the pins sticking out) to the correct ports of the Raspberry Pi.
                                <!-- TODO: add a wiring diagram -->
                            <li>Using the male to male jumper wire, connect the third left most socket of the last matrix to the 9/MISO port on the Raspberry Pi.
                                <!-- TODO: add a wiring diagram -->
                        </ol>
