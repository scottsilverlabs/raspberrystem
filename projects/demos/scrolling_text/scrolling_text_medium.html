        <h1>Scrolling Text - Medium <br> Displaying "Hello" and then "World"</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be displaying the text "Hello" followed by "World"
            in succession one after another. 
            
            <h2>How it works:</h2>
                <p>To display the text we are following the same process we did in <a href="scrolling_text_easy.html">easy</a>.
                (Drawing the text with <code>led_matrix.text</code>, then showing it with <code>led_matrix.show()</code>)
                
                <p>However, one change we do is clear the screen of the previous text displayed using <code>led_matrix.erase()</code>
                before displaying the next piece of text and then create a delay using <code>time.sleep(1)</code> to allow 
                the user to see the text for a second before the next text is displayed.
                
                <p>Also, to keep this going on forever we use a <code>while</code> loop.
                
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the text "Hello" and "World" to something else.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Does it matter what order you put the text in?
                        </ol>
                    <li>Change the <code>time.sleep(1)</code> lines to a different number of seconds instead of 1.
                        <ol>
                            <li>What happens when you make the number larger than 1?
                            <li>What happens when you make the number between 0 and 1 (like 0.5)?
                            <li>How could you make a longer pause after displaying "World" and before the next "Hello"?
                        </ol>
                </ul>
