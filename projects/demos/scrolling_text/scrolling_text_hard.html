        <h1>Scrolling Text - Hard <br> Scolling "Hello World!"</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be scrolling the text "Hello World!" accross the LED matrices.
            
        <h2>How it works:</h2>
            <p>To be able to scroll the text we are using the same technique of continously erasing
            and displaying the text like in <a href="scrolling_text_medium.html">medium</a>, but instead of
            changing the text to be displayed each time, we are changing the position where the text is being
            displayed on the LED matrices.
            
            <!-- TODO: make the following simipler.... --->
            <p>We can change the position of the text when we draw the text by providing a second parameter 
            to <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code> which draws a <code>LEDSprite</code> variable on the display
            at the given position. (If a position is not provided the program assumes you want the position
            to be (0,0))
            
            
         <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the text "Hello World" to something else.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Isn't that awesome?!
                        </ol>
                    <li>Change delay time in <code>time.sleep(.1)</code> to a smaller or larger number.
                        <ol>
                            <li>What happens as you change the number?
                        </ol>
                    <li>Change the number 1 in line <code>x = x - 1</code> to a larger number.
                        <ol>
                            <li>How does this change the way the text scrolls?
                            <li>What happens when you make it too big of a number? Why does this happen?
                        </ol>
                </ul>
