# Displaying text on the led matrix. ===============================================

# Draw the text "hello" on the LED matrix
# NOTE: this doesn't actually show the text on the display until we call led_matrix.show()
led_matrix.text("hello")

# To be able to see the text we need to tell the Raspberry Pi to show the drawn text on the led matrix.
led_matrix.show()


# Yay!! We can see the text on the led matrix!

# Try changing "Hello World" to something else and see what you get. :)  (Don't forget the " " )
