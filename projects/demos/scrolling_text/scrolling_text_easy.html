        <h1>Scrolling Text - Easy <br> Displaying "hello" on the LED matrices</h1>
            <p>In this project we will be displaying text onto the LED matrix display.
            However, it will not be scrolling. For text that is scrolling, see <a href="scrolling_text_hard.html">hard</a>.
            
            <h2>How it works:</h2>
                <p>Drawing the text on the LED matrix is a 2 step process:
                    <ol>
                        <li>First we must draw the text on the screen with <code>led_matrix.text()</code>
                        <li>Then we must tell the Raspberry Pi that we want to show what we have drawn
                            on the LED matrices, with <code>led_matrix.show()</code>.
                    </ol>
                        
            <h2>Try This:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the text "Hello" to something else and see how it displays.
                        <!-- TODO: have questions like this? -->
                        <ol>
                            <li>Does your whole text display?
                            <li>How could we show longer text?
                        </ol>
                    <li>Add more than one <code>led_matrix.text()</code> lines, with different text in the parentheses before calling <code>led_matrix.show()</code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What happens? Why?
                            <li>How do you think we could show one piece of text, wait a couple seconds, clear the screen,
                            and then display the next piece of text?
